# bubbles-interactor
A random message display application made for the Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather.

This project was created as a gift my friend, Bubbles, inspired by a coat he
made for himself for Burning Man. The coat featured Altoids tins covering the
whole coat labeled "Open for an Interaction". People would open the boxes and
inside they would find a playful interaction to engage with. This coat became
the foundation of our future camp, based on creating interactions for people.

I thought it would be nice if there were further options for interactions for a
person once they had opened all of the interaction tins, and then knew what all
of them were. So I decided to create a digital version of the interaction tins
that could have an arbitrarily large number of random interactions to go
through.

I chose the Adafruit ESP-S2 TFT Feather for this project primarily for it's
built in screen and small size. It's perfect for creating a simple wearable
screen that can be easily programmed.
